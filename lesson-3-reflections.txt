When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I colaborate with others, work on differnet computers or just want to have a backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	continually connecting to github might slow my commits down.
	I do not want to publish things that are not ready.
	If others also work on that branch it would force me to work on merges all the time when they have pushed news.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Cloning a repository from soewhere else, forking someone elses repository, branching my repository to work on something outside the master branch (exp, new feature)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	How else could you diff to it? Also it allows you to track what changes you made until the last pull and if its time to push ...

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Hmm, need to think about this...

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	I would always wor with branches ...even when I am on my own working on something larger. You never know when you need to stop what you are working on to focus on something else and suddenly you need a functioning master branch to fix somthing while you are in the middle of something else. 
	For collaboretion I do not see any other way as working directly in the master forces others to work with our changes even if they do not want to yet.
